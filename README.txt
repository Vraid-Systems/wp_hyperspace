"Hyperspace: a fun, blocky,
one-page design with a lot of color, a bit of animation, and an additional "generic" page template
(because hey, even one-page sites usually need an interior page or two). Hope you dig it :)"

Adaptions for WordPress

To populate the home page, go to the dashboard/home page sections.
There you can create each of the home page section.
Each section has an order value, which determines in what order it will appear on the homepage.

Each section can have an associated featured image.
Each featured image can have its position set to [top|center|bottom left|center|right].

The content of the home page section excerpt will be displayed if present.
A 'learn more' button will appear if the home page sections have text in the main content area.

Each section has an associated style [styel1, style2, style3, style1-alt, style2-alt, style3-alt].

Sections may also have child sections using the standard Wordpress child/parent page controls.
